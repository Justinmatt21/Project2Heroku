# Snow Emergency Heroku Dashboard

interactive dashboard link:  https://snowemergencyheroku.herokuapp.com/

This dashboard visualizes Minneapolis snow emergencies from 2015 to 2019.  We showed the distribution of tows and tickets per community and neighborhood for each snow emergency; in doing so, we showed that tows and tickets are frequently clustered around the same locations regardless of snow emergency or year.  We also visualized the total number of tows and tickets per emergency and plotted this alongside the city's towing revenue and expenses for that year to examine any possible relationship between tows and revenue.  Finally, a satellite image and description of each storm can be viewed at the bottom of the page.

Contains only the files needed to run the application via Heroku.  See our other repository (https://github.com/Justinmatt21/SnowEmergencyDashboard) for all of the files which contain our data cleaning, database creation, and other relevant files

Wait 10-20 seconds for all charts to load properly, since charts are constructed by actively creating and pulling from a database.
